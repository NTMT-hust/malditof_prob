# Probabilistic_MALDI-TOF_AST

Repository for the **Multi-label classification to predict antibiotic resistance from raw clinical MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry data** project.

The project is divided in 2 folders:

- [**Experiments**](experiments/README.md): containing all the scripts used for the development of the machine learning (ML) models. Includes data processing, exploration and modeling.
- [**Program**](program/README.md): Containing the source code of Fast AST, a program with a graphical user interface built to easily predict the AMR profile of a bacterium using the ML models built with the **Experiments** scripts. 

## Installation

All code was built in Python 3.11.5. All packages used can be found in the file [requirements.txt](requirements.txt). They can quickly be installed via `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Creation of a new, clean, Python environment is suggested before installation of requirements.
